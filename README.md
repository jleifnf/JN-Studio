# JN-Studio
by Jeff Lin and Nick Zauner

## Purpose
What movies produce the best performance at box-office?

## Methodology 
Some areas you can look to examine are movie genres (Thriller, Drama, Comedy, etc.), movie ratings, budget, social media discussion, and critic or user reviews. Your team gets to define its _own questions_ about the movie industry and then use its knowledge of descriptive statistics and the EDA process to try and answer those questions. <br>
Questions to consider:
- How are you defining _success_ ?
 - Return on investment?
 - Revenue?
 - Garunteed box-office hit?
 - Social media buzz?

## Data Sources
  - data:
    - MovieData.csv
  - documentation
    - This comes straight from [The-Numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all)
    - this includes all data from The Numbers! it is not subset to 2010-2018


## Project Checklist:
- [ ] Use data from at least two sources
   - [ ] Establish naming conventions for variables and datasets
   - [ ] Clean dataset & record parameters used to clean the data
     - [ ] You may use Pandas or Python functions
     - [ ] Document every step of the cleaning process
     - [ ] Create at least _two new features_ that were not present in the original data sets
- [ ] Use Pandas and Numpy to generate useful metrics for comparing films

- [ ] Posted to git repository:
   - [ ] A README.md listing project members, goals, responsibilities, and a summary of the files in the repository
   - [ ] At least 10 commits
     - [ ] Must include short, descriptive commit messages
     - [ ] Each project member should commit at least once
   - [ ] A Jupyter notebook targeted to a technical audience that contains
     - [ ] Clean and commented code so an independent party can replicate your analysis and justify your analytical choices
     - [ ] Code should follow Pep8 standards
     - [ ] Custom functions should be stored in .py file and imported whenever possible
   - [ ] Your final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis
   - [ ] A narrative Jupyter notebook targeted to a non-technical audience that provides:
     - [ ] The purpose of your analysis and why it matters
     - [ ] 4 well annotated visualizations created using Matplotlib/Seaborn
     - [ ] 2 meaningful summary tables using Pandas
     - [ ] At least four actionable insights (What type of films should they be looking to produce? What should the budget requirements be? Should they recruit certain actors for their films?)
   - [ ] A pdf of no more than 8 slides used in project presentation targeting non-technical audience
     - [ ] Apply consistent and effective formatting to create a “professional” appearing deck
     - [ ] Write an abbreviated high-level overview of methodology
     - [ ] Justify at least 2 concrete recommendations 
     - [ ] include exported visualizations from analysis
     - [ ] Target the presentation to a _non-technical audience_, avoid jargon
     - [ ] Take no more than 5 minutes to present
 
## Specifics:
### This project is in groups. Groups will be announced on Saturday!

### Timeline

Wednesday - Project Assignment 
 - schedule Monday check in with coach (TBD)

Saturday - Groups assigned

Monday - Check in with coaches 
 - review data cleaning
 - provide url of project repository
 - review at least one table/chart
 - review work plan created for how teammates will approach and divide work
 
Tuesday - Demo presentation with feedback from instructors 
 - have polished draft of deck completed
 - have polished version of jupyter notebook completed
 
Wednesday 
 - afternoon project presentation
 - mini science fair open to staff and fellow students

### Project Review
If any requirements are missing or if significant gaps in understanding are uncovered, be prepared to do one or all of the following:
 - Perform additional data cleanup, visualization, and/or feature selection 
 - Submit an improved version
 - Meet again for another Project Presentation
 
What won't happen:
 - You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
 - You won't be put on the spot without support
 - There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it
